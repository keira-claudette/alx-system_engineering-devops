	 to server IP 8.8.8.8

- ##### 1-distributed_web_infrastructure
Contains link to a design with the following components:
- 3 servers
	 - 1 web server (Nginx)
	 - 1 application server
	 - 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)

	 - 3 firewalls
	 - 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
	 - 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

- ##### 3-scale_up
